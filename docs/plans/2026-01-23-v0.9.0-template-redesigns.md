# v0.9.0 Template Redesigns - Planning Document

**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** High

---

## Overview

Comprehensive redesign of all 6 signature templates based on 2026 email signature best practices research. Focus on clean, minimalistic, mature designs aligned with Zoho's brand ethos.

## Deferred from v0.8.0

The template redesign work was deferred from v0.8.0 to keep that release focused on the color theming system. Templates are functional but need refinement based on modern email signature conventions.

## Key Findings from Best Practices Research

### 2026 Email Signature Standards

**Dimensions:**
- Width: 300-600px (optimal: 450-500px)
- Height: 150-200px (keep signatures compact)

**Layout:**
- **Left-aligned** layouts (matches email text flow) - NOT centered
- Clear typography hierarchy (name 16-18px, title 13-14px, contact 13px)
- 2-3 colors maximum (avoid excessive color blocks)
- Web-safe fonts (Arial, Verdana, Georgia)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Clean and minimalistic
- Professional and mature
- Remove excessive design elements (boxes, backgrounds)
- Focus on readability and scannability

## Templates Requiring Redesign

### Priority 1: Executive Template (Currently Centered)

**Current Issues:**
- Centered layout doesn't match email text conventions
- Most emails are left-justified, centered signatures look odd

**Proposed Design (Option 5: Two-Column with Accent Line):**
- Left-aligned layout
- Vertical accent line (2px) separating logo from content
- Logo on left (60px), contact info on right
- Clean typography hierarchy
- Maintains executive elegance without centering

### Priority 2: Bold Template (Excessive Colored Box)

**Current Issues:**
- Colored name/title block feels excessive
- User feedback: "looks excessive", "not a fan of the boxes"
- Doesn't match "clean, minimalistic, mature" ethos

**Proposed Design (Option 1: Sidebar with Vertical Bar):**
- Left-aligned logo with thin vertical accent bar
- Clean text layout without colored backgrounds
- Accent color used sparingly (vertical bar, links)
- Professional without being flashy
